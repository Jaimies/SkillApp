<b>The 10000 hour rule</b>
The 10000-hour rule claims that in order to become a master in a given field, one needs to practice for about 10000 hours. Although recent studies have shown that the number of hours is not the same for everyone, practice remains the only way of achieving mastery.

<b>We value your privacy</b>
Your data is only stored on your device and is never uploaded to our servers (in fact, we don't have any).

You can optionally backup your data to a private folder in your Google Drive. These backups will only be accessible by SkillApp.

<b>We love feedback!</b>
